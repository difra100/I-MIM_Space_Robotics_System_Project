\section{Jacobian computation}\\
Knowing the position of the end effector as a function of the joint variables through the forward kinematics, $p_E(q)$, it is possible to express the linear and angular components of the end effector's velocity by means of the geometric Jacobian. In the case of a 2-Link manipulator, the Jacobian is a $6\times{2}$ matrix, composed by the linear and angular Jacobian, respectively $J_L$ and $J_A$, such that 
$J = \begin{bmatrix}
J_L\\
J_A\\
\end{bmatrix}$, and:

$$ \left \{
\begin{array}{lr}
  \dot{p}_E = J_L(q)\,\dot{q}  \\
  \omega_E = J_A(q)\,\dot{q}
\end{array}
$$
\\
By doing so, it is possible to express a direct relation between the velocities of the end effector and the joint velocities based only on geometric quantities. Dealing with two rotative joints, each of them gives the following Jacobian:
$$ \left \{
\begin{array}{lr}
     %J_L(q) =  z_{i-1}\times{p_{i-1,E}} = \pdv{p_{0,E}(q)}{q_i} \\
     J_{L_i}(q) =  z_{i-1}\times{p_{i-1,E}} = \dfrac{\partial{p_{0,E}(q)}}{\partial{q_i}} \\
     J_{A_i}(q) = z_{i-1}
      
\end{array}
$$
where $z_{i-1}$ and $p_{i-1,E}$ are both referred to the base frame of the manipulator.\\
