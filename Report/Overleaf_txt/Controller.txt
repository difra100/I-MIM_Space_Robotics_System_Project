\subsection{External disturbance}
At this point the trajectory is available in discrete time, for each time step we can retrieve the configuration through the dynamic model. Now, it is possible to take in account the atmospheric drag, $a_D$, modelled as follows:
$$a_D=\frac{1}{2}\,c_D\,\rho\,S_A\,v_{SC}^2$$
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $c_D = 0.3$, is the drag coefficient;
    \item $\rho = 10^{-14}\; [kg/m^3]$, is the atmospheric density of Mars atmosphere considered constant;
    \item $S_A = 28.27\; [m^2]$, is the surface of the antenna, supposed to be always fully exposed;
    \item $v_{SC}$, is the spacecraft velocity.
\end{itemize}\\
To relate this external disturbance to the joint space is sufficient to multiply by the transposed of the Jacobian. Under the hypotesis that the drag effects are only dependent on the position of the EE, it is possible to write:
$$\tau_a=J_L^T\,a_D$$

\subsection{Mismodelling}

\subsection{Control scheme}
The controller is modelled as a feedforward nonlinear control with external perturbations.\\

The configurations given in input is "disturbed" by artificially adding an AWGN, so to have the error, $e$, computed as the desired configuration minus the actual one:
$$e=\theta_d-\theta$$
The commanded acceleration, $\tau'$ can be computed as:
$$\tau'=\ddot{\theta}_d+k_v\,\dot{e}+k_p\,e$$
with $k_v=400$ and $k_d=2\,\sqrt{k_v}$ being the control gains. Then, the effective required torque is easily obtained:
$$\tau=M\,\tau_d+V-\tau_c-\tau_a$$
To evaluate the differential error to be integrated it is also computed:
$$\ddot{e}=\ddot{\theta}_d-M_{true}\left(-V+\tau_c+\tau_a+\tau\right)^{-1}$$
After the integration the integral error is retrieved and the effective trajectory can be evalueted.\\
